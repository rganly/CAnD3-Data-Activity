Clear the data space
1. Load required packages for analyses.  
2. Converting data from the GSS into a tibble.  
3. Cleaning and coding variables to be used in the analyses.  
4. Dropping all variables but the ones used in analyses.  
5. Labeling those variables. 

```{r}

#Follow Tyler's instructions from the Shell File

#1. Load required packages for analyses

# Clear dataspace
rm(list = ls())

library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(skimr)
library(naniar)
library(Hmisc)
library(sjlabelled)
library(gt)
library(gtsummary)
# Rachel's comments: Found these packages in the list on Github



# 2. Converting data from the GSS into a tibble.  

gss<-read.csv("gss_2017.csv") #Loaded file gss_2017 per the instructions
gss<-as_tibble(gss)


# 3. Cleaning and coding variables to be used in the analyses.  
# Rachel's comment: cannot find a list of variables to be used, except by reading the code


  # Self-Rated Health (Ordinal)
      # Coded Excellent (1) - Poor (5)
  # Self-Rated Mental Health (Ordinal)
      # Coded Excellent (1) - Poor (5)
  # Educational Attainment (Ordinal)
      # Coded HS or Less (1) | Some College (2) | Bachelor's + (3)
 # Age in Years (Continuous; capped at 80)

  # Sex (Binary)
      # Coded Male (0) | Female (1)

  # Marital Status (Changing from Nominal to Dichotomous)
      # Married/Common Law = Married (1) | All Else = Not Married (0)

  # Family Income (Ordinal)
      # Values are: 1) Less than $25k; 2) $25k to $49.999k; 3) $50k to 74.999k;
      #             4) $75k to $99.999k; 5) $100k to $124.999k; 6) $125k or more

  # Number of Children in Household (Discrete)

 # Visible Minority (Binary) 
      # Coded Yes (1) | No(0)


# LABELLING VARIABLES AND VALUES


#4. Dropping all variables but the ones used in analyses.  


#5. Label variables. 


```


```{r}
#Handle Missing Data

# Rachel's comment: I could not find out how to do this without reading the code in full
